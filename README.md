# Crypto Whale
## Description
Crypto Whale is a SPA made with ReactJS and MaterialUI. It allows the user to simulate investing in cryptocurrencies, risk/reward free.
## Usage
1. The user starts with $1 million in their virtual portfolio. They are able to view current market data from the top 100 cryptocurrencies, according to the CoinGecko.com API.
2. When the user selects a cryptocurrency from this list, they are shown detailed, current market data for that coin, with the option to simulate buying or selling that coin using their virtual money.
3. When the user buys a cryptocurrency, that data is posted to db.json using RESTful API, and their virtual balance decreases.
4. When the user sells a cryptocurrency, db.json is updated and their portfolio amount updates.
5. The user is able to navigate between their portfolio, the list of cryptocurrencies, and may view any coin they select from their portfolio list or the top-100 list.
